# Starlink TLE Propagation
Simple visualisation scripts/notebooks in Python for propagating Starlink satellite trajectories and simulating orbits around a simplified 3-D Earth model (with no oblateness).

---
An example of a Starlink satellite trajectory is shown below for NORAD ID 45184, also known as STARLINK-1205. The TLE and epoch times/start epoch can easily be changed, while the main function can be adapted to propagate multiple TLEs from a catalogue as well.
